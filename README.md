This front connects to an API to get the servers and do our searches.

### TODO:
- [ ] write documentation
- [ ] tests for components
- [ ] improve the servers table: update the server working info
- [x] improve the servers table: allow to select a server by click

Just for fun and learn! 🐣
Keep going 🙌
